# **ECS152 Final Project: Congestion Control over UDP**

## **Overview**

This repository contains the final project for ECS152: Computer Networking, completed in collaboration with **Akhil Sharma**. The project demonstrates various congestion control mechanisms built on top of a basic UDP service, showcasing their functionality and performance.

The repository features four working implementations:
1. **Stop and Wait**
2. **Fixed Sliding Window**
3. **TCP Tahoe**
4. **TCP Reno**

Additionally, an experimental implementation of **TCP Vegas** is included, though it is non-functional due to time constraints.
